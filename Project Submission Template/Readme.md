# Peoria Civic Hackathon Submission Example

This is a sample submission for the Peoria Civic Hackathon. This is just a sample of what your repo can look like when you submit it
to us as part of the final process for judging the hackathon.

## Description

This project has as a main objective to give realiable infrastructure unformation to everyone while engaging the community.

For this objective there should be a synergy between the existing information and the information that the community has available.

As a first ArcGIS is a robust maping solution that can be implemented on many platforms (Javascript, AndroidSDK, iOS SDK, Java, Xcode, .NET and QT) easily which helps us as it eliminates the work of trying to implement different third party solutions which may or not may work seamlessly

Another important part of the project is the way it encourages the community to crowdsource te information it uses on the service to make it more reliable. If a group of people advises about an unfinished project or weather damage on a finished project it can help in the longterm by making the already existing information more reliable.
